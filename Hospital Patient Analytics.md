Hospital Patient Dashboards provide real-time, comprehensive views of patient data, integrating information such as admissions, discharges, vital signs, lab results, and treatment progress. These dashboards enable healthcare providers to monitor patient status efficiently, track key metrics like bed occupancy and resource utilization, and make data-driven decisions to improve patient care. By visualizing trends and alerts, the dashboards enhance clinical workflow, improve communication between departments, and support better outcomes through timely interventions.
